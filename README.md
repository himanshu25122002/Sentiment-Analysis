## ðŸ§  Sentiment Analysis Using VADER

A lightweight Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that analyzes the sentiment of user-generated text, such as customer reviews or social media comments. This system uses the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis model to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The project demonstrates real-world application of rule-based NLP in opinion mining and product feedback analysis.
